# Filament

This set of files is provided as supplementary material to the article "The asymptotic coarse-graining formulation of slender-rods, bio-filaments and flagella", to be published in Journal of the Royal Society Interface, authored by C. Moreau, L. Giraldi, and H. GadÃªlha.

These files can be run on MATLAB in order to simulate the behaviour of an elastic filament in a fluid at low Reynolds number.

How to use it :

MAIN file : choose 
- final time and time step
- "sperm number" (the lower, the more rigid the filament is)
- number of segments (the simulation is more accurate with more segments but don't use more than approx. 80 - a good choice is between 20 and 40)
- an initial shape for the filament
- relaxation, oscillation or magnetic case

The code solves the dynamics and returns the time (time) and state (traj) vectors.
A graphic visualisation starts at the end.
